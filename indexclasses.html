                <h1>Fighters, Wizards, Bards, galore!</h1>
                    <p>  Your class is one of the most important parts of building a character in DND and whether you're swinging a sword, smiting your foes, or becoming one with nature this guide on Class will be set you on the path to glory!<br> </p>
                <h1>Choose How You Want To Play</h1> <p>If you want to destroy you enemies with powerful blows but arent too keen on the complexities of magic, pick a martial charcter. If you want the flexibility of magic without the extra rules and strategy to wield necessary to wield it, choose a Half-caster. And if you want to become the spell-slinging magician you were always destined to be and dont care about doing a lot of math, take the plunge and become a Full-caster! 
                    </p>
                <h1>Pick A Subclass</h1>
                    <p>Once you've decided on your class, next youll want to pick your subclass. Subclasses give your character a specific theme to focus on and specific powers that are flavored to where theyve gotten their power and potential plot threads as to why. When choosing your subclass try to keep in mind how that choice will tie into their backstory. </p>
                <h1>Multiclassing</h1>
                    <p>Everytime your character has leveled up, you have the option to multiclass into another class besides the one youve chosen. Multiclassing is very complicated but it can create unique and powerful class combinations when done correctly, as well as be narratively satisfying as your character changes throughout your story.</p>
