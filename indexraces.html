                <h1>Who Will You Be?</h1>
                    <p>  In DND there is a whole host of interesting and unique playable races. Some like halflings, gnomes, dwarves, and goblins scurry about beneath the other larger races. Half orcs and goliaths are the perfect tanks, strong and foreboding. Some hail from the other planes of existence like gensai, tieflings, aasimar, and dragonborn. Or you could be boring and play a human I guess idk. Regardless of what race you pick we have an intuitive guide for how to play your new adventurer! 
                    </p>
                <h1>Backstory</h1>
                    <p> Your Race will determine how others see you, what your background will be, and root you in the world of your Dungeon Master's Creation as your characters culture influences how they react to and see the world.</p>
